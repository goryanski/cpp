Equilibrium is understood as
a state of absolute rest or a state of uniform rectilinear motion
a state of absolute rest
state of uniform rectilinear motion
3

3
What kinematics studies?
the geometric shape of mechanical movement without taking into account the reasons causing these movements
different types of body movement
movement of physical bodies under the action of applied forces
3
What dynamics study?
basic laws of mechanical motion of physical bodies
movement of a material point

3
What is an absolutely rigid body?
a physical body in which the distance between any two points always remains unchanged
a body whose dimensions in this problem can be neglected
a physical body, the balance of which is considered in the problem
3
What is called strength?
measure of mechanical interaction of physical bodies
the nature of the interaction of bodies
characteristic of the impact of one body on another body
3
List the factors that characterize the effect of force on the body
point of application, magnitude and direction of force
modulus and direction of force
point of application and magnitude of force
3
What is called a system of forces?
the combination of several forces applied to one body
the sum of the forces acting on the body
several forces applied to different bodies
3
What systems are called equivalent?
systems that have the same mechanical effect on the same body
forces applied to one body
forces acting on different bodies
3
What is called reactive force?
the magnitude and direction of the force acting from the side of the bond on the body
the force acting from the body on the connection
the strength of the bond
